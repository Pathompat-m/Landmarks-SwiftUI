# Landmarks-SwiftUI

## Overview

Landmarks is an app designed to help users explore their favorite destinations. Whether it's lakes, mountains, or rivers, users can discover new places to visit. The interface offers a choice between a Featured view or a list view for easy navigation. By tapping on a location, users can access detailed information including location on the map, images, and descriptions. Users can also mark their favorite places with a star and filter their selections for a personalized experience. Additionally, users have the option to personalize their profiles with details such as their name, notification preferences, seasonal photos, and goal dates. The profile also features badges and animated graphs to track recent hikes.
